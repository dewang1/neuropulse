# NeuroPulse: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) Detection Device & Web App

## Overview
This project aims to design, build, and test a device and web application for early detection of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). The device performs a nerve conduction study by measuring electrical signals transmitted through the median nerve, using an Arduino, an EMG sensor, and an electrode. The web app provides users with a platform to access and analyze their data securely.

## Features
### Device
- **Nerve Conduction Study**: Measures electrical signals in the median nerve.
- **Hardware Components**:
  - **Arduino**: Controls data collection and processing.
  - **EMG Sensor**: Detects and records nerve impulses.
  - **Electrode**: Delivers electrical stimulation to the median nerve.

### Web App
- **Product Overview & Instructions**: Provides details about the device and usage guidelines.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Patient data is stored securely using Firebase.
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in and access their personalized data.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays sensor data through interactive graphs and statistics for analysis.
